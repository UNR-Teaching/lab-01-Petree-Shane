Lab 1

The '>' combined with the 'ls' command created newfile.txt and listed the files in my lab directory directly inside newfile.txt. I was also able to use the 'ls' command afterwards to list newfile.txt in my lab directory now that it had been made.
After adding newfile.txt, the git status command tells me that a file has been added and will be commited in my next commit unless I remove it.
The 'git diff' command shows me any new changes that were added to a file since it was last added using the 'git add' command.
